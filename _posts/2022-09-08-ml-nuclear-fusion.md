title: Machine Learning for Nuclear Fusion
---

Hello! I'm Emily, a third year PhD student at UCL's [Centre for Data Intensive Science](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/) and the [Culham Centre for Fusion Energy](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/).
I'm interested in helping make nuclear fusion a viable energy source in the effort to combat climate change. 

My research focus is applying data driven tools to nuclear fusion applications. Currently I am investigating **physics-informed neural networks** for their ability to **accelerate plasma simulations** on the JET reactor. My other research interests include deep learning surrogate models, cybersecurity and plasma disruption prediction. 

I'm also a fellow of the [Software Sustainabilty Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) where I advocate for better software practices in academia and teach introductory programming skills with the [Software Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/).  

Find an overview of my research and technical experience below or on my [CV](/public/CV_ELewis.pdf). Find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/esllewis) where I mainly talk about science outreach and unorthodox uses of ML. Checkout [github](https://github.com/esl-lewis) for my personal programming projects.
